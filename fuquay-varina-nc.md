## Visiting Fuquay-Varina, NC

### Fun things to do

- Visit Raven Rock for great hiking
- So sad - I didn't update before I created this branch so my old version of the doc is here!


### Great places to eat

- Aviator's Smokehouse and Brewery
- ~~Cooley's~~
- Snoopy's
- Char Grill is famous (around here) for burgers

### Great places to stay

- None, better to stay in Holly Springs or Apex.
- There is a neat bed and breakfast south of town called Mariel's place.
